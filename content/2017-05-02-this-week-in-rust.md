## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1685: Deprecate anonymous parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1685).
* [RFC 1868: A portability lint](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1868).
* [RFC 1824: Proposal for default crate recommendation ranking](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1824).
* [RFC 1866: Improve the `assert_eq` failure message formatting to increase legibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1866).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Extend entry API to work on borrowed keys](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1769).
* [disposition: close] [Generators](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1832).
* [disposition: merge] [Remove static bound from type_id](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1849).
* [disposition: merge] [extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [disposition: postpone] [Add `SafeDeref` and `SafeDerefMut`, equivalent to `Deref` and `DerefMut` but which are guaranteed to always return the same object](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1873).
* [disposition: close] [Allow the name (qualifier) of an enum variant to be elided in expressions and patterns whenever it can be inferred](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1949).
* [disposition: merge] [Expand and stabilize `impl Trait`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1951).

## New RFCs

* [Amend RFC 1242 to require an RFC for deprecation of crates from the nursery](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1983).
* [Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

We're making good progress and the style is coming together. If you want to see the style in practice, check out [our example](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/example/lists.rs) or use the [Integer32 Playground](https://play.integer32.com/) and select 'Proposed RFC' from the 'Format' menu. Be aware that implementation is work in progress.

PRs:

* [Statements](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/81)

Issues in final comment period:

* [Ordering of types of groups within a module](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/71)
* [Struct and tuple literals](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/64)
* [Array literals](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/63)
* [Where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [Imports (`use`)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/24)

# Quote of the Week

> Indeed, it was that very event that lent the world to ruin...
>
> It had been decades since the last line of C code was erased, and the last C compiler (written, ironically (but unsurprisingly), in Rust) engraved onto a golden disc and launched toward that distant star around which the GooglePepsiMusk Sphere's construction could be faintly observed. To even utter that fell syllable would be met with swift retaliation from the paramilitary _Borrow Xekkers_ (the alphabet as well having been altered to better suit this shining memory-safe utopia). The whole world, everything, had all been rewritten in Rust, and at last the world knew universal peace and prosperity of boundless proportion.
>
> But something stirred... a prophecy ancient in origin. **The Second.0 Coming**. And when realized at last, the world was divided between the forward-thinking devotees of 𝕽𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝕿𝖜𝖔-𝕻𝖔𝖎𝖓𝖙-𝕺𝖍 and those vainly clinging to 𝕽𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝕺𝖓𝖊-𝕻𝖔𝖎𝖓𝖙-𝕱𝖔𝖚𝖗-𝕳𝖚𝖓𝖉𝖗𝖊𝖉-𝕬𝖓𝖉-𝕾𝖊𝖛𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖊𝖊𝖓.
>
> And thus did The Great Schism rend interstellar civilization in twain.
>
> There was but one ray of hope. As the fires of war rushed toward the newly-completed GooglePepsiMusk Sphere, its cadre of elite 10<sup>10x</sup> programmers set to work. Their task: to write the most advanced compound artificial intelligence ever known, one capable of averting the catastrophe consuming the universe: _AlexKryton.exe_<sup>[1]</sup> . Due to Rust's incredible productivity benefits, they completed their task in a mere 22 seconds--and thanks to the Rust compiler's incredible performance, spent only nine months waiting for it compile. Using the artificial black hole at the center of the GPMS, and with only moments to spare, they sent their AI back in time, to the era of Rust's birth: 2011.
>
> That's the whole story. And yet those perceptible among you may ask: "_which version of Rust did they use?!_" Alex alone knows...
>
> <sub>[1] Yeah, Windows won. Sorry.</sub>
